- 👋 Greetings to whoever is reading this, I’m @Liutsiia
- 👀 I’m interested in psychology and information technology. And it’s even more interesting to combine them :)
- 🌱 I’m currently studying psychology at the university and the Javascript by my own efforts
- 💞️ I don’t know who I want to cooperate with yet, because I am new to the site, but soon there will be information in this row
- 📨 I can be reached via the most unpopular messenger with a paper plane icon (nickname: L_alter)
